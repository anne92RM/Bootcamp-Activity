# Predicting Gentrification

This thought experiment will explore **gentrification**, a social phenomenon where affluent people move to lower-income neighborhoods.

* What means can we use to determine how long the trend has been happening?
  -Price increase on home, property taxes and basic goods
  -How many properties were sold TY vs LY or PY
* What proxies might we use to identify gentrification in nonobvious ways?
  - Traffic
  - Median income change via census
* How might you create a visualization of this data to best “tell the story”?
  - Population growth over time
  - Increase of Median Income over time
  - Property Tax and Home Value over time
  - Increase in Rent Over Time
* Pay special attention to details like:
  - Income
  - College Degrees
  - Number of Schools and Hospitals
* What data will you use to build your model?
- Census Data
- Public Data
* How will you retrieve the data?
    - Public Records
    - Social Media
    - Surveys
* What is your final “story”?
